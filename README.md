# Graph RAG - Neo4j Integration

## Overview

This project demonstrates the integration of **Graph RAG** with **Neo4j** using Python. It includes functionalities to create **Person** and **Disease** nodes in Neo4j, establish relationships between them, and visualize the relationships using **Pyvis** in a **Streamlit** app.

The project also includes automated testing using **pytest**, and the code is containerized using **Docker**. The application can be built and deployed using **GitHub Actions**.

## Features

- **Create Person**: Add a new person with a name and age to the Neo4j database.
- **Create Disease**: Add a new disease with a name and description.
- **Create Relationship**: Create a relationship between a person and a disease in the database.
- **View Diseases**: Visualize the diseases of a person in a **graph** format using **Pyvis** and **Streamlit**.
- **Automated Testing**: Run tests to ensure the application works as expected.
- **Docker Integration**: Build and run the application inside a Docker container.
- **CI/CD**: Automated build, test, and deployment pipelines using **GitHub Actions**.

## Installation

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/graph-rag-project.git
cd graph-rag-project
```

### Set Up Environment

1. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Neo4j Setup

Ensure you have access to a **Neo4j database** (you can use **Neo4j Aura** or a local Neo4j instance).

1. **Set up environment variables for Neo4j**:
   - `NEO4J_URI`: The URI to connect to Neo4j (e.g., `neo4j+s://<your-neo4j-uri>`).
   - `NEO4J_USERNAME`: Your Neo4j username.
   - `NEO4J_PASSWORD`: Your Neo4j password.

   You can either set these variables in your `.env` file or directly as environment variables in your terminal.

### Docker Setup

To run the app in a Docker container:

1. **Build the Docker image**:

   ```bash
   docker build -t graph-rag-project .
   ```

2. **Run the Docker container**:

   ```bash
   docker run -p 8501:8501 graph-rag-project
   ```

   This will start the **Streamlit app** at `http://localhost:8501`.

### Streamlit App

To run the app locally without Docker:

```bash
streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
```

---

## Testing

To run the tests using **pytest**:

```bash
pytest tests/
```

---

## GitHub Actions

This project uses **GitHub Actions** for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD). The workflows are defined in `.github/workflows/python-app.yml` to:

- **Run tests** on every push to the `main` branch.
- **Build and push Docker images** to Docker Hub after tests pass.

Make sure to set the following **GitHub secrets**:

- `DOCKER_USERNAME`: Your Docker Hub username.
- `DOCKER_PASSWORD`: Your Docker Hub password or access token.
- `NEO4J_URI`: The URI to your Neo4j database.
- `NEO4J_USERNAME`: The Neo4j username.
- `NEO4J_PASSWORD`: The Neo4j password.
